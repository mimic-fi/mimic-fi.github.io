          <h2>MIMIC TERMS & CONDITION</h2>
        </Line>

        <div>
          Welcome to https://mimic.fi, a website-hosted user interface (the
          “Interface” or “App”) provided by Mimic Team. (“we”, “our”, or “us”).
          The Interface provides access to a decentralized tool to manage defi
          treasuries in a trustless way (the “Protocol”). This Terms of Service
          Agreement (the “Agreement”) explains the terms and conditions by which
          you may access and use the Interface. You must read this Agreement
          carefully. By accessing, joining any strategy or using the Interface,
          you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by
          this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not
          authorized to access or use the Interface. Exit now.
          <h2>1. Modification of this Agreement</h2>
          We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement
          from time to time. If we make any modifications, we will notify you by
          updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining a
          current version of the Agreement at https://mimic.fi/terms. All
          modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your
          continued use of the Interface will serve as confirmation of your
          acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree with any
          modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing
          and using the Interface and the protocol.
          <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
          To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally
          binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at
          least eighteen years old and have the full right, power, and authority
          to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for
          which you may access or use the Interface. You further represent that
          you are not a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or
          group that is subject to economic sanctions by the United States, or
          where your use of the Interface would be illegal or otherwise violate
          any applicable law. You further represent that your access and use of
          the Interface will fully comply with all applicable laws and
          regulations, and that you will not access or use the Interface to
          conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.
          <h2>3. Proprietary Rights</h2>
          We own all intellectual property and other rights in the Interface and
          its contents, including (but not limited to) software, text, images,
          trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and designs. Unless
          expressly authorized by us, you may not copy, modify, adapt, rent,
          license, sell, publish, distribute, or otherwise permit any third
          party to access or use the Interface or any of its contents. Provided
          that you are eligible, you are hereby granted a single, personal,
          limited license to access and use the Interface. This license is
          non-exclusive, non-transferable, and freely revocable by us at any
          time without notice or cause. Use of the Interface or its contents for
          any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly
          prohibited. We own all intellectual property and other rights in the
          Interface and its contents, including (but not limited to) software,
          text, images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and
          designs. Unless expressly authorized by us, you may not copy, modify,
          adapt, rent, license, sell, publish, distribute, or otherwise permit
          any third party to access or use the Interface or any of its contents.
          Provided that you are eligible, you are hereby granted a single,
          personal, limited license to access and use the Interface. This
          license is non-exclusive, non-transferable, and freely revocable by us
          at any time without notice or cause. Use of the Interface or its
          contents for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is
          strictly prohibited. Unlike the Interface, the Protocol is comprised
          entirely of open-source software running on the public Ethereum
          blockchain and is not our proprietary property.
          <h2>4. Prohibited Activity</h2>
          You agree not to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the
          following categories of prohibited activity in relation to your access
          and use of the Interface: A. Intellectual Property
          Infringement. Activity that infringes on or violates any copyright,
          trademark, service mark, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy,
          or other proprietary or intellectual property rights under the law. B.
          Cyberattack. Activity that seeks to interfere with or compromise the
          integrity, security, or proper functioning of any computer, server,
          network, personal device, or other information technology system,
          including (but not limited to) the deployment of viruses and denial of
          service attacks. C. Fraud and Misrepresentation. Activity that seeks
          to defraud us or any other person or entity, including (but not
          limited to) providing any false, inaccurate, or misleading information
          in order to unlawfully obtain the property of another. D. Market
          Manipulation. Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or
          regulation concerning the integrity of trading markets, including (but
          not limited to) the manipulative tactics commonly known as spoofing
          and wash trading. F. Any Other Unlawful Conduct. Activity that
          violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation of the United States
          or another relevant jurisdiction, including (but not limited to) the
          restrictions and regulatory requirements imposed by U.S. law.
          <h2>5. No Professional Advice</h2>
          All information provided by the Interface is for informational
          purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice. You
          should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any
          information contained in the Interface. Before you make any financial,
          legal, or other decisions involving the Interface, you should seek
          independent professional advice from an individual who is licensed and
          qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.
          <h2>6. No Warranties</h2>
          The Interface is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. We
          do not guarantee that the Site will be secure or free from bugs or
          viruses. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim any
          representations and warranties of any kind, whether express, implied,
          or statutory, including (but not limited to) the warranties of
          merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. You acknowledge
          and agree that your use of the Interface is at your own risk. We do
          not represent or warrant that access to the Interface will be
          continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure; that the information
          contained in the Interface will be accurate, reliable, complete, or
          current; or that the Interface will be free from errors, defects,
          viruses, or other harmful elements. No advice, information, or
          statement that we make should be treated as creating any warranty
          concerning the Interface. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume
          responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by
          third parties concerning the Interface.
          <h2>7. No Fiduciary Duties</h2>
          This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any
          fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you
          acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities
          to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or
          liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and
          liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated.
          You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you
          are those set out expressly in this Agreement.
          <h2>8. Compliance Obligations</h2>
          The Interface is operated from facilities within the United States.
          The Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in other
          jurisdictions. By accessing or using the Interface, you agree that you
          are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and
          regulations that may apply to you. You may not use the Interface if
          you are a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or group
          that is subject to economic sanctions by the United States, or if your
          use of the Interface would be illegal or otherwise violate any
          applicable law. The Interface and all of its contents are solely
          directed to individuals, companies, and other entities located within
          the United States.
          <h2>9. Assumption of Risk</h2>
          By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you
          understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
          blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the
          usage and intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether
          (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum
          Token Standard (ERC-20). You further understand that the markets for
          these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but
          not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and
          regulation. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting
          with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum or
          Polygon are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You
          further acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or
          all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol.
          <h2>10. Third-Party Resources and Promotions</h2>
          The Interface may contain references or links to third-party
          resources, including (but not limited to) information, materials,
          products, or services, that we do not own or control. In addition,
          third parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of
          the Interface. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any
          such resources or promotions. If you access any such resources or
          participate in any such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and
          you understand that this Agreement does not apply to your dealings or
          relationships with any third parties. You expressly relieve us of any
          and all liability arising from your use of any such resources or
          participation in any such promotions.
          <h2>11. Release of Claims</h2>
          You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your
          access and use of the Interface and your interaction with the
          Protocol. You further expressly waive and release us from any and all
          liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any
          way relating to your use of the Interface and your interaction with
          the Protocol.
          <h2>12. Indemnity</h2>
          You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our
          officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and
          subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations,
          losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access
          and use of the Interface; (b) your violation of any term or condition
          of this Agreement, the right of any third party, or any other
          applicable law, rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party’s access
          and use of the Interface with your assistance or using any device or
          account that you own or control.
          <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors,
          employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable
          to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential,
          or exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss
          of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising
          out of or relating to any access or use of the Interface, nor will we
          be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking,
          tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Interface or the
          information contained within it. We assume no liability or
          responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of
          content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
          whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the Interface; (c)
          unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in our
          control, or the use of any information or data stored therein; (d)
          interruption or cessation of function related to the Interface; (e)
          bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to
          or through the Interface; (f) errors or omissions in, or loss or
          damage incurred as a result of the use of, any content made available
          through the Interface; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal
          conduct of any third party. Under no circumstances shall we or any of
          our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates,
          or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims, proceedings,
          liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount
          exceeding the amount you paid to us in exchange for access to and use
          of the Interface, or $100.00, whichever is greater.
